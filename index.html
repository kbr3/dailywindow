  <blockquote> Before you know it, a sense of God’s wholeness, everything coming together for good, will come and settle you down. It’s wonderful what happens when Christ displaces worry at the center of your life.

  <blockquote> Love is God’s preservative. It surrounds our souls with a power greater than the power of the devil and the world around us. It keeps us balanced; it insulates us against the hostility that exists in our world. Love is the shelter of the Most High;
    it is the substance of the Place of Immunity.
    <br> <em> [Francis Frangipane] </em>
